Design and Build a simple CRUD API for  todos.
- Each todo has an id, a title and status.
- There are 3 values for status [In progress, done, not started]).
- I can only delete a todo that has status = ‘done’.
- I can update the status of a todo
- I cannot edit the title of a todo that has status = "done".
- I should be able to view all todos, todo by Id, and todos by status
